It just looks better when there's a couple of lines up here, but I have nothing else to say yet.

## Grunt Commands

### `grunt`
Starts the express server.

### `grunt test`
Grunt test will lint and test source.

### `grunt dev`
Grunt dev forces through the tests, and starts the express server.  Good when you're not worried about the linter, or unit tests failing.

### `grunt live`
Grunt live runs through the same setup as `grunt dev` but then watches the code.  Any file saves will trigger restart the server with the new changes.

### `grunt inspect`
Grunt inspect will start the node inspector, and the express server at the same time, so that you can debug the server in the chrome web inspector.

Yup.
